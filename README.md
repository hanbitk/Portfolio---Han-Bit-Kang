<p>I spent a year learning Front-End development skills such as creating interfaces using HTML, CSS, and JS on my own. I wanted to gauge my progress, so I decided to build a portfolio to see how much I had learned.</p>

<p>In 2023, I moved to South Korea to enroll in HangHae 99 Academyâ€™s Front-end Development Bootcamp. I will complete the course in 4 months.</p>

<p>I'm currently working on rebuilding my project using React. I hope to finish it as soon as possible and share it with you all!</p>
